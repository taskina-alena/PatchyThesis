Molecular dynamics simulations of patchy particles system. 

The folder /progs is used to initialise the system (initialisation.py), run the simulation (actions.py) and analyse trajectories (analysis.py). The file drawing.py allows to make sketches of patchy particles.

The file scripts/run_sim.py can be used to run different simulations

Data analysis and visualisation are shown in notebooks/ folder. It includes bonds, structure, mobility and phase_diagrams analysis.
